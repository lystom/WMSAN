# Welcome to WMSAN

**WMSAN** pronounced [**wam-san**]
## Description

**WMSAN** for **Wave Model Sources of Ambient Noise** is a user-friendly Python package to help seismologists model their observations through maps of ambient noise sources from [WAVEWATCHIII](https://www.weather.gov/sti/coastalact_ww3) hindcast outputs, but also to compute synthetic spectrograms (e.g., [Ardhuin et al., 2011](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2011JC006952); [Stutzmann et al., 2012](https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/191/2/707/644255)) and seismic noise correlations (e.g., [Ermert et al., 2020](https://se.copernicus.org/articles/11/1597/2020/)). In particular, we provide [Python scripts](api_overview/api_overview.md) and [Jupyter Notebooks](user_guide.md) to compute maps of secondary microseismic noise sources distribution, synthetic seismic cross-correlations, temporal variations of sources and synthetic seismic spectrograms.
